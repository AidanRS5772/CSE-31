    1. The error on occurs on line 25 ``scanf("%d", input);``.
    2. Add a reference modifier to the ``input`` variable.
    3. A copy of sum is made when being passed to ``read_values()`` function and the original declaration in main is never modified.
    4. Pass in the pointer of sum and modify the dereferenced value.

    1. Yes
    2. Since str1 is an array of chars passing it in as varaible to the function doesn't copy it passes the reference to the data itself. Therefore, in using it to concatinate the words makes it so that the data on the previous run is still present because it is not cleared from the array. You can fix this by making new memory for the concatinated data on the heap that is not used over again in the next loop.
    3. This happens from overflowing the 10 char allocated memory of the ``str`` variables.
