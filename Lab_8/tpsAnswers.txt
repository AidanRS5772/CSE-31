TPS 2:
    1. It will produce 29 if 5 is entered and that is verified.
    4. We would store the value in $a0 register.
    5. We would expect the return value to be stored in the $v0 register, so we would first load the value from the $v0 register into the $a0 register for printing then load the $v0 register with the appropriate value.
    7. Space was made on the stack to save 3 integers, the first of which you would want to store is the $ra register.
    10. We need to save $a0 to the stack because that register will be used in the subsequent function calls and we need the value it contains after the function call.
    12. If we call recursion right away the return value will be over written so we need to save the return value before the next function call.
    15. The value that needs to be restored is the $ra register.
