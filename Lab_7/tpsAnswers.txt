TPS 1:
1. A procedure is a block of code that performs a task, a function takes in some data and returns a result from that data, and a method is a function associated with an object in code.
4. This is line 20 and it adds register $a0 and $a1 and stores the result in $v0.
5. Yes, you can use a j instead of a jr.
6. The return address is being saved on line 11 into the $ra register. The value being saved to is zero this value does not make sense in context of the program.
8. 0x00400028 is the address of the instruction that follows the j Sum.
9. Yes it is correct.
10. 15
11. we should do jal Sum in stead of a jump.

TPS 2:
1. The output will be and ended up being 38.
2. Main calls Sum in which it calls Sub and then adds the result of the sum to x+y and prints the result.
3. When jal is called, the return address is saved for where it was called into $ra. However, when calling a function in a function the return address is overwritten so to go back to main after the call to SUB in SUM you need to save the return address somewhere.
4. You can save the argument $a0 onto the stack.
5. The $s0 register is overwritten but then is also used after the call to SUM this will lead to the incorrect result. The value should be stored into a temporary register in the function SUM.
